Conway's Game of Life
This is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, inspired by Robert Heaton's tutorial.

How It Works
The game runs on a grid of cells, which can be alive (#) or dead (empty).
Each cell's state changes based on its neighbors, following Conway's rules:
Live cells die if they have fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors.
Dead cells come to life if they have exactly 3 live neighbors.
Running the Game
Install Python and NumPy:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python game_of_life.py
Watch the simulation evolve in your terminal!

Customize
Change the grid size by editing this line in the script:
python
Copy code
initial_state = random_state(20, 20)  # Change 20, 20 to your desired dimensions
Adjust the speed by modifying this line:
python
Copy code
time.sleep(0.03)  # Increase for slower, decrease for faster
